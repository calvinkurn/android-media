## Overview

Chatbot or conversational AI is a computer program that can understand userâ€™s query and answer it instantly, which can form conversation between human and machine. Chatbot in Tokopedia is used to answer simple questions, where the complex one will be handled by CFS (Customer First Squad) / human agent.



---

### Background

Chatbot can give a lot of benefits for Tokopedia, the following are some of them

- Answer simple and repetitive questions automatically, so CFS can focus to handle complex inquiry
- Understand user intention regarding general inquiry or even troubleshooting
- Provide answer based on specific condition since we use information from transaction invoice
- Can be integrated with internal & external system such as ticketing system, logistic, etc.
- Can be used anytime since it operates 24/7
- Instant answer within seconds



---

### Project Description

Chatbot help reduce ticket count to our customer service agent and give user faster response. It helps in creating more cost optimisation. Since it is available 24/7, user can get faster response for their queries.



---

## Tech Stack

Applink - `tokopedia://chatbot/1234567` ; `1234567` is the `messageId` for the user

- `MediaUploader` - This library is used to upload videos. [Not used for image upload as we need to do secure upload which is not supported by `MediaUploader` yet]
- `MediaPicker` - This library is used to pick image/videos from gallery.
- `Exoplayer` - Used for playing videos.
- `Server Logger` - Used to send logs to `New Relic` in case of GQL errors, Message Id conversion issue and socket issues
- `chat_common`- It uses this module to have common chat functionalities. `Topchat` also uses `chat_common` module



---

## Flow Diagram

- Step 1 - TANYA gives welcome message to user, then user click an invoice. User can click `Masalah lainnya` if it's not related to transaction.
- Step 2 - Users select a topic from button action list and will follow the flow until leaf intent. Once they reach leaf intent, chatbot will show a probing for helpful question (Yes or No answer).
- Step 3 - User fill `CSAT` survey if they answer helpful question with "Yes". The conversation will end in here.
