## Overview

### Background

Accelerating hyperlocal expansion through localized campaign experiences and seller app parity

Throughout 2021, several “hyperlocal campaigns” have been carried out to provide local buyers with more selections of campaign products (e.g. Kejar Diskon for New Buyer, local Kejar Diskon, etc.), considering 73% of campaign products are still coming from Jabodetabek. The local campaign supply is mainly coming from RGX. Within 10 months, the number of campaign products in 14 hyperlocal cities have increased by 3x from 8k in Jan’21 to 27k in Oct’21 and orders have increased by 7x from 50k orders to 327k orders (~22% of overall KD orders). Seeing good traction from local sellers and buyers, in H1 we will accelerate the availability of good campaign products in hyperlocal areas by: 

Adding promotion tools in Seller App, starting with Slash Price and Flash Sale Toko in H1, considering 75% of active sellers outside Jabodetabek use Android with avg. time spent of 20 mins vs 13 mins on the Desktop. With this, we aim to increase participation from local sellers and available campaign products by 3x. To ensure these campaign products can be easily discovered by local buyers, we will combine these seller-side improvements with hyperlocal initiative from the front funnel to target campaign page entry points ‘based on the buyers’ location, boost campaign products from nearby locations and direct buyers to location/ warehouse with the lowest Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”).
