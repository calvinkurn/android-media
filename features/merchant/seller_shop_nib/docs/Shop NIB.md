## Background

Quoting from project PRD: Tokopedia would like to support the government's initiative of increasing the adoption of NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha) as the legal identification for businesses in Indonesia, including SMEs. On top of that, NIB will also be useful for GoTo for future KYB (KYC for business) implementation, which is now being planned on GoTo level and aimed to be implemented in H2 2023 or H1 2024.

## Project Description

The main objective of this project are to achieve these points:

1. Support government regulations as a partner
2. Regulation compliance (since NIB is actually required by the government)
3. Beneficial for sellers as well (for halal/BPOM certifications, SNI, business loans, etc.)
4. One of the foundations for KYB legalities
5. Enable sellers to submit their NIB to our system
