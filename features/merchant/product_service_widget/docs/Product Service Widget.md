## Overview

Product Bundling is one of the most common methods a seller uses to uplift their sales. To ease user to discover bundling products, we proposed to develop Bundling as a promotional tool which will enable sellers to add multiple products and sell them as a bundle.

### Background

Product Bundling is one of the most common methods a seller uses to uplift their sales. In order to have a bundling scheme, currently sellers in Tokopedia are creating a new SKU manually and input the new image, product name, description, promotion price, and other product information for each package—identified as a hard bundling method. This hard bundling strategy has been used by 1.3 million merchants with estimated ~15 mio products created with a total of 300 billion TIV generated in a month.  

However, we found that creating a hard bundling causes new challenges and limitations to our seller and buyers. For sellers, it will be a high operational cost to create and maintain a bundled product since the stock and other product attributes are not synchronized with the main product. For the buyers, finding and purchasing a bundled promotion becomes a challenge since there is no clear information about the bundling promotion and the visibility on the benefit on our current system beside the product name, description, and product price that is modified by each seller ([Appendix 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyWYGCnWocVlOwQgR8y9bvBASR39sTj6HExzbeiVSZg/edit#heading=h.5phkm0i7iv41)), resulting in a difficulty to discover bundling products.

Hence, we proposed to develop Bundling as a promotional tool which will enable sellers to add multiple products and sell them as a bundle which offer a lower price as an added-value, while still giving them flexibility to sell the products individually.

#### Project Description
