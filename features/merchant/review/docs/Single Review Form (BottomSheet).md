# Overview

The single review form is a page built using a BottomSheet and placed in a transparent activity. The purpose of using an activity to wrap the bottom sheet was to make the page accessible through an app link. On this page, the user can submit a review for a single product. The form structure is static with some static data and some dynamic data controlled by the backend (ex: template list, bad rating category list, etc).

# GQL

There are 2 groups of GQL queries that will be executed when the page is opened:

- Mandatory → The productrevGetFormV2 and productrevGetBadRatingCategory are required and needed to render the whole form.
- Optional → The productrevIncentiveOvo and productrevGetListPersonalizedReviewTemplate is an optional query that needed to be sent but does not necessarily need to return a successful response.

GQL queries that will be executed when the user submits the review:

- `productrevIncentiveOvo` → This query is used to check whether the user has any pending incentive eligible review
- `productrevSubmitReviewV2` → This query is used to submit the inserted review data
- `productrevGetPostSubmitBottomSheet` → This query is used to determine whether we need to show a toaster or bottom sheet after successfully submitting the review data
