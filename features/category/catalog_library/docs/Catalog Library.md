<!--end expand-->

## Overview

Catalog is a collection of products that has an identical brand, type, and specifications (a SKU) from various brands to provide users with useful information to make a more confident purchase decision within Tokopedia. These are the problems we try to solve by Catalog Library:

1. User has limited access to limited catalog pages in Tokopedia: entry point to catalog depends on search autocomplete, Category Landing Page (CLP)

, and carousel on Search Result Page (SRP)

. The search autocomplete accounts for >60% of catalog sessions, however, the entry point is intermittent depending on 1) keywords searched by users and 2) other ongoing campaigns occupying the autocomplete, which could replace the catalog’s position on autocomplete anytime. Moreover, CLP and search carousel cannot accommodate featuring every single catalog on their page due to real estate problems.
2. User doesn’t know which product has catalog and which product does not: the catalog team decides on which products to cover based on which products/categories have the highest number of order/TIV. The SKU selection therefore is non sequential, i.e. catalog does not cover every single SKUs in handphones category. Without knowing the available catalog, users may feel lost when trying to compare products.
3. User cannot access the complete list of catalog/navigate seamlessly through different categories available on catalog: catalog does not have a homepage to list all the available catalog pages or enable browsing within catalog. Users might find a hard time to navigate from one page to another, making their experience in catalog not optimal.

To help answer those problems, we propose to create a catalog indexing page or a Catalog Library. Catalog Library provides structured, indexed catalog pages for users to explore. Ideally, this initiative is aimed to fix navigation funnels of Catalog in Tokopedia Apps so that Catalog Library will be the final landing page for every catalog entrypoint. 

### Project Description
