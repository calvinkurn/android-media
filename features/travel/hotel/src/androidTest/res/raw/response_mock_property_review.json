Everything was perfect, every inch of this property is beautiful and perfectly maintained, the pool villa is the most beautiful room we had so far in all the hotels we stayed at and the personal was attentive and very friendly. The decoration is absolutely stunning and all the furniture were a very good quality. Food was also good and reasonable prices. \n\nI enjoyed the peaceful and quiet atmosphere and the privacy of the villa. This hotel constitutes the ultimate luxury for the best value of money.\n\n\n\n",
