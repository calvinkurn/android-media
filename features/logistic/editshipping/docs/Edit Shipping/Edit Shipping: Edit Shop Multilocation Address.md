<!--end expand-->

## Overview

### Background

Today, Tokopedia only facilitates multiple-locations through Tokopedia Warehouses (TokoCabang) managed by Tokopedia’s partners. However, the use cases for TokoCabang is not fit with the needs of (a) offline retailers that already have strong network presence (b) track inventory across these locations (c) nature of business that is not fit to be handled by third party, e.g. frozen food, large volume items (Furniture, Cars), high valuable items (Jewelry). 

This limitation then resulted in many of the merchants restoring to either (a) Set up and operating multiple stores to activate different locations (b) Manually routing incoming orders offline to fulfill from multiple warehouses. For buyers (especially outside Jabodetabek), this experience makes them struggle to discover localized products that require same-day/instant delivery, e.g. fresh, frozen, ready-to-eat, through our platforms (search, browse). Building multiple ship location capabilities will provide huge benefits for our sellers, our buyers as well as Tokopedia.
