## Overview

### Background

Currently, Cari Driver Baru CTA located inside the Lacak Page, since the funnel is to deep most of the sellers didn't aware that Tokopedia has this self service feature. Sellers often requesting to find new driver via Chatbot and this will create the CS Ticket Join Category 'Sulit Dapat Drvier' that Contributes 4.2% of Logistics CS Ticket (as per September 2022). By making the Cari Driver Baru feature prominent on Seller Order List and Order Detail that can be accessed via Three Dots, we aim seller to aware and use this self service feature and bring the CS ticketÂ Join Category 'Sulit Dapat Drvier' down to 2%.

### Project Description

Create a new *Cari Driver Baru* bottomsheet for the seller to finding new driver. This bottomsheet will display the invoice number and action button to find a new driver. There is a countdown timer display if the seller is not yet available to search for drivers and the button will be disabled.

## How-to

To show find new driver bottomsheet you can call `ApplinkConstInternalLogistic.FIND_NEW_DRIVER` with parameter `order_id` and `invoice`



```
startActivityForResult(RouteManager.getIntent(
  this,
  ApplinkConstInternalLogistic.FIND_NEW_DRIVER
)
  .apply {
      putExtra(LogisticSellerConst.PARAM_ORDER_ID, {order_id})
      putExtra(LogisticSellerConst.PARAM_INVOICE, {invoice})
  }, request_code
)
```

  
There are several resultCode that will be returned in `onActivityResult`



```
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
  when (resultCode) {
    Activity.RESULT_OK -> {
      // returned when users success find new driver
    }
    Activity.RESULT_FIRST_USER -> {
      // returned when users failed find new driver
    }
    Activity.RESULT_CANCELED -> {
