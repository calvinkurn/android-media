## Overview

### Background

Currently, CS Ticket Join Category 'Ubah Jadwal Pickup' Contributes 2.28% of Logistics CS Ticket (as per September 2021), and most of the orders are from GO-JEK and Grab courier (96%). By allowing Seller to have self-service to Reschedule Pickup, we aim to bring the CS ticket down to 1%.

Top 4 reasons from Seller to create CS TicketÂ  'Ubah Jadwal Pickup' based on [sampling data 23-29 August](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nbk-W71LYWanN4BgQtG7iPJJrpL78yyuB6arikUn_XY/edit#gid=1971677337):

1. Want to reschedule without telling the reason (186) %
2. Want to find a new Driver (133)
3. Shop closed (52)
4. Fake Pickup (29)

## How-to

```
startActivityForResult(RouteManager.getIntent(this, ApplinkConstInternalLogistic.RESCHEDULE_PICKUP,  {order_id}))
```

  
There are several `resultCode` that will be returned in `onActivityResult`



```
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
  when (resultCode) {
    Activity.RESULT_OK -> {
      // returned when users success reschedule pickup
    }
    else -> {
      // returned when users do nothing / failed reschedule pickup
    }
  }
}
```
