## **Overview**

### Project Description

Tracking page takes care of every user needs when it comes to tracking, including reference number, courier name, estimated time arrival, image when product is picked up and delivered, also tracking feature so user can track their own product(s). Recently, tracking page have a new addition called tipping section, because there is a habit where our buyer wants to give tips to the Gojek/Grab Driver. The buyer gives tips when the driver asks about parking fees or the buyer generously wants to give tips.

But currently, there is no seamless flow for buyers to give tips on Tokopedia App. Buyers need to give tips via cash. This pain point is frustrating for buyers where buyers are not at home, buyers living at apartments (need to go down to the lobby). And it gets worse when right now during a pandemic buyer does not want to meet the driver directly to hand over tips via cash.

To solve this, Tokopedia wants to provide a seamless flow for buyers to give cashless tips to drivers via Tokopedia App. With this product, we will solve buyer pain points where the buyer does not need to meet the driver and give cash tips.
