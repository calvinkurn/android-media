###### User profile feed tab for feed post creationPR: <https://github.com/tokopedia/android-tokopedia-core/pull/30392>
<!--end expand-->

## Overview

**People** is a module name for User Profile feature under Feed. This module include all of the need for User Profile, but there is some other file/resources that we used from other module such as `content_common` & `feed_component`module.

### Background

Content tribe is planning to open content creation to non-sellers in Q1 2022 in order to increase content supply and variety within Feed and Play platform

. Naturally, these non-seller users will need a dedicated page to consolidate and showcase all of the content that they have created. User profiles will be developed to satisfy this need and more by allowing users to identify each other, find the content of a specific content creator, and follow them to see their future content in their Feed timelines.

### Project Description

People module or in the feature name called User Profile is a feature where user can see their profile information related to the content. Inside this User Profile, users can see their following and follower list, they can also upload feeds or videos and can view that in this User Profile. There is Shop Recommendations too which will appear when the user has no posts at all.  
  
Here where you can open this User Profile page inside our Tokopedia Main App.

- **Feed**

Inside Feed, you can see there is user account profile picture in the very left of the Feed tab. You can directly open the User Profile Page from this.

- **Akun Saya**

User who wants to creating some feed post will get this onboarding if they account has no username yet or never accept the TNC for creating post. This onboarding currently only for feed creation only; live stream & shorts will be in the next development.

## Tech Stack

There is several tech stack that we used in this User Profile page. 

- **Repository** : a new layer between ViewModel & UseCase. The advantages:


	- Easier to mock network since we only need to mock the repository instead of the usecases.
	- ViewModel constructor won’t be bloated by UseCases anymore.
	- As a place to translate DTO to UI Model.
- **MVI** : we haven’t implemented a full MVI yet, but we are trying to make it MVI. Any user events will be passed to ViewModel with only 1 entry point and the result will be emitted by only 1 UI State, so the pipeline flow is clear and easier to understand.
- **Flow** : previously we are using LiveData, but for new development we start using Flow (StateFlow & SharedFlow). Flow has a lot of useful operator than LiveData, and it’s suitable for our usecase where we combine all individual state to 1 UI state only. [Click here to see the official documentation.](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)
- **Fragment Factory** : Most of the newer features already adopted Fragment Factory. With Fragment Factory, we are able to inject the dependency directly to Fragment constructor. [Click here to see the official documentation.](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentFactory)

## How-to

To open People module we need `userID` or `userName` as its parameter inside the `RouteManager.route()` and use `ApplinkConst.PROFILE` as the applink.



```
RouteManager.route(requireContext(), ApplinkConst.PROFILE, userID/userName)
```
