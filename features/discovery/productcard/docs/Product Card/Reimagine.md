## Overview

### Background

Product card is getting longer. The more information we provide in product card, the more decision fatigue for our buyer. Hence, we need to show only the important information that help on purchase decision making

Currently, product card is using the masonry layout (lego-like layout). On this layout, each product card will have dynamic position based on the product card height. Because of that, it's quite hard for our buyer to compare the information since they cannot see the product card information side-by-side easily.

### Project Description

The goal of a product card reimagine is to provide potential buyers with all the necessary information about a particular product in a clear, concise, and compact manner, so that buyer is able to decide what product to purchase. Moreover, the slot on product card is very limited, we only show the relevant information to the buyer.

From tech side, based on previous experience, now we have decided to split Product Card into multiple template or layout based on how it will be used. Different use cases will have different components inside the Product Card, for example Product Card in regular grid or list layout and Product Card in carousel layout will have different size and different labels. If a new component is added into the Product Card, we must specify in which template it will be added into, and develop only in that template.

This approach has a benefit of not cluttering all Product Card that is used in all pages with new labels or new components. If a component is only used in regular grid Product Card, it will not exists in carousel Product Card. However, this approach also have a downside where if a new component is needed in all templates, then we have to develop multiple times for all the templates.

For all templates, we will still use the same `ProductCardModel`. These are the current templates of the Product Card:

| Template       | Release Status    | Class                       |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Grid (regular) | Released MA-3.240 | ProductCardGridView         |
| Grid Carousel  | Released MA-3.238 | ProductCardGridCarouselView |
| Grid Small     | Not Released      | -                           |
| List (regular) | Not Released      | -                           |
| List Carousel  | Not Released      | -                           |
| List Small     | Not Released      | -                           |

This is usually said `Cashback xx%`. The label background and text color will be rendered based on the label group's `type`, which is usually `lightGreen`.

#### Label Group - Credibility

For Grid Carousel, this label will not be rendered if there is Label Benefit.

#### Label Group - Assigned Value
Label Assigned Value is rendered below Product Image if `labelGroupList` contains a label group with `position` = `ri_assigned_value`.
- The text will be rendered from label group's `title`.
- The image icon will be rendered on the left side of the label based on label group's `imageUrl`. If it's empty, then the icon will not be shown.
- The background color will be rendered based on label group's `style` with key `background-color`. The value will contain a String of colors, separated with `,`. If it's only one color, it will be rendered as solid single color. If it's more than one color, it will be rendered as gradient color.
