## Overview

### Background

Product card is getting longer. The more information we provide in product card, the more decision fatigue for our buyer. Hence, we need to show only the important information that help on purchase decision making

Currently, product card is using the masonry layout (lego-like layout). On this layout, each product card will have dynamic position based on the product card height. Because of that, it's quite hard for our buyer to compare the information since they cannot see the product card information side-by-side easily.

### Project Description

The goal of a product card reimagine is to provide potential buyers with all the necessary information about a particular product in a clear, concise, and compact manner, so that buyer is able to decide what product to purchase. Moreover, the slot on product card is very limited, we only show the relevant information to the buyer.

From tech side, based on previous experience, now we have decided to split Product Card into multiple template or layout based on how it will be used. Different use cases will have different components inside the Product Card, for example Product Card in regular grid or list layout and Product Card in carousel layout will have different size and different labels. If a new component is added into the Product Card, we must specify in which template it will be added into, and develop only in that template.

This approach has a benefit of not cluttering all Product Card that is used in all pages with new labels or new components. If a component is only used in regular grid Product Card, it will not exists in carousel Product Card. However, this approach also have a downside where if a new component is needed in all templates, then we have to develop multiple times for all the templates.

For all templates, we will still use the same `ProductCardModel`. These are the current templates of the Product Card:

| Template       | Release Status    | Class                       |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Grid (regular) | Released MA-3.240 | ProductCardGridView         |
| Grid Carousel  | Released MA-3.238 | ProductCardGridCarouselView |
| Grid Small     | Not Released      | -                           |
| Grid (regular) | Not Released      | -                           |
| Grid Carousel  | Not Released      | -                           |
| Grid Small     | Not Released      | -                           |

#### Label Group - Benefit
Label Benefit is rendered if `labelGroupList` contains a label group with `position` = `ri_product_benefit`. The text will be rendered from the label group's `title`, and the label background will be rendered based on the label group's type. This is usually `lightGreen` for this label.

#### Label Group - Credibility
Label Credibility is rendered beside rating if `labelGroupList` contains a label group with `position` = `ri_product_credibility`. The text will be rendered from the label group's `title`. This is usually said `xx+ terjual` (sold count).

#### Label Group - Ribbon
